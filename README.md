## Project Overview
This project involves performing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of user order data. The key areas of analysis include:
° Number of orders per user.
° Most popular dishes.
° Number of orders by age, location, and favorite meal.

The analysis results are represented using bar charts, which allow easy interpretation of trends and insights.

## Data Files
The project consists of the following datasets:
° `UserDetails.csv`: Contains user information such as name, age, location, and favorite meal.
° `CookingSessions.csv`: Contains data on cooking sessions, including dish names, meal types, and ratings.
° `OrderDetails.csv`: Contains information about the orders placed by users, including order ID, meal type, order status, and more.

## Analysis and Visualizations
The following analyses have been performed:
° **User Order Stats**: Number of orders per user.
° **Popular Dishes**: The most popular dishes based on the number of orders.
° **Age Analysis**: Orders grouped by age.
° **Location Analysis**: Orders grouped by location.
° **Favorite Meal Analysis**: Orders grouped by favorite meal.

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to help understand these insights.
